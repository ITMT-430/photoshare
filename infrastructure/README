folder to hold infrastructure scripts and stuff

LAUNCH NOTES: when running the scripts, use command source and then the path to the file, for example if im in /home and my script is in /home/downloads you would use "source /downloads/script.sh

for security, I made the key pair a variable where it says -k $1.  For this, after you type the command for the script you would add your key-pair name afterwards like "source /downloads/script.sh keypair-name"

Also, remember to terminate instances when you are done using them / testing
